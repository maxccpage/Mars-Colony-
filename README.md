# Project 5 - Mars Colony Project

[](https://maxccpage.github.io/New-York-Times-API-/)

### Summary

The Mars Colony App was created to be a Single Page Application (SPA) that could be used to register a new colonist on Mars. For this particular project we used Angular 2 and Typescript for the build, and SASS for the basic styling.

### Languages and Tools Used

<pre> 
* React JS
* CSS/SASS
* API's
* Node JS
* Git/Github
* Postman
* Gulp
</pre>

### Learning Outcomes

This project gave us the chance to delve into concepts of Angular 2 JS and apply them by building this SPA. By developing this project I have was able to gain a strong foundation of understanding of the important Angular concepts such as: components and modules, routing and navigation, classes and interfaces, and last but not least classes, interfaces and decorators that allow for form and API representation.
